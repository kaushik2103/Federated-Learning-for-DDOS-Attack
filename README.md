# Federated-Learning-for-DDOS-Attack
This project uses Federated Learning to build a collaborative DDoS detection system. Participants train Random Forest models on private data, and updates are aggregated with FedAvg. The system detects and blocks threats in real-time via a two-panel UI, enhancing security without compromising data privacy.
## Evaluation Metrics 
Using random forest classification model of machine learning we achieve the following accuracy:
- Accuracy: `>79%` for Global Model

Using deep learning model LSTM we achieve the following accuracy:
- Accuracy: `>92%` for Global Model
